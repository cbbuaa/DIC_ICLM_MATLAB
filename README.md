### Introduction
**Two-dimensional Digital Image Correlation (2D-DIC)** is an accurate and high-efficiency optical method for motion and deformation meausurement of planar sample subjected to in-plane deformation.
This is a MATLAB<sup>@ </sup> Toolbox for the **inverse compositional Levenbergâ€“Marquardt (`IC-LM`)** algorithm combining reliability-guided displacement tracking strategy. As a comparison, the inverse compositional Gaussian-Newton (`IC-GN`) algorithm is also invloved. You can choose different shape function, including first-order and second-order shape function. The **major advantage** of the `IC-LM` algorithm is that it has **obviously larger converge radius** while holds **almost the same accuracy and effeciency** compared with the classical `IC-GN` algorithm.
This MATLAB<sup>@ </sup> toolbox of `IC-LM/IC-LM2` algorithm involves some of the advanced features of DIC algorithm. We have tried to make the codes modularized and readable. Hope it could reveal the detail inside DIC for you and contribute your project.

### Usage
1. Download the project and unzip it into a folder;
2. Before running, you need to set some **key parameters in `paramset.m`**, such as **subset size**, **step size**, **iteration method**, whether **nomalization** is used, **threshold of iteration number**, etc
3. Run `demo.m`. In the first pop-up window select one reference image, and in the second pop-up window select a deformed image or a set of deformed images.
4. The bicubic B-spline interpolation C++ MEX file has already been created. However, if you have changed the source code, please create it again.
**On MacOS platform**
    * Install Xcode on your mac;
    * Type the following command in MATLAB command window;
  ``
            mex -v -setup C;
            mex -v -setup C++; 
  ``
    * Edit and save your C++ code in file `BicubicBsplineInterp.cpp`;
    * Copy the former file to your work directory, and then type the following command in the command window:
``
            mex BicubicBsplineInterp.cpp
``
    * You will get a file `BicubicBsplineInterp.mexmaci64` in your work directory. Finally you can use it like regular MATLAB function.

    **On Windows platform**
    * Install C and C++ compiler. Here the free MinGW-w64 C/C++ complier is recommended. Please check the compatible version from [MATLAB support](https://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/52848-matlab-support-for-mingw-w64-c-c-compiler). We have confirmed that MATLAB R2019a is compatable with [MinGW-w64 V6.3.0](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win64/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/6.3.0/threads-posix/seh/x86_64-6.3.0-release-posix-seh-rt_v5-rev2.7z/download) on windows 10.
     * Type the following command in MATLAB command window;
  ``
            mex -v -setup C;
            mex -v -setup C++; 
  ``
    * Edit and save your C++ code in file `BicubicBsplineInterp.cpp`;
    * Copy the former file to your work directory, and then type the following command in the command window:
``
            mex BicubicBsplineInterp.cpp
``
    * You will get a file `BicubicBsplineInterp.mexmaci64` in your work directory. Finally you can use it like regular MATLAB function.

5. On the reference image, draw a rectangle region of interest (ROI) by specifying the upper left corner and lower right corner in sequence.
6. Select a seed point on the reference image, then just wait.
7. The results are saved in the same folder with the same file name but format of `.mat`;
8. Note that you can easily parallelize the algorithm by changing the ``for...end`` to ``parfor...end`` loop in the `demo.m` file. Each thread will match one deformed image.
9. If you need to evaluate the performance of the method, you can use some [open-source code](https://github.com/cbbuaa/DIC-Image-Simulation) to simulate some desired deformation images.
10. Enjoy.


### Key features
* **Gaussian pre-filter** is added to reduce sub-pixel registration bias error of DIC;
* **Corse-to-fine**, **FFT** and **Manually selection** are optional ways for initial displacement guess of a seed point;
* **Tricubic B-spline interpolation** scheme is used to get the gray intensity on the deformed image at sub-pixel location. MATLAB<sup>@ </sup>and C++ implementations of the interpolation are optional in the source code. The default is the C++ version, and you can choose also MATLAB<sup>@ </sup> version.
* **Reliability-guided displacement tracking strategy** is used for fast, robust and accurate point registration. Of course you are not necessarily uses it, but use that without reliability-guided displacement tracking strategy;
* **Inverse compositional Levenberg-Marquart algorithm** is adopted for larger converge radius while keeping the same accuracy and effeciency.
* **First-order** and **Second-order** shape functions are used to describe the deformation of each subset, and you can choose from them accordingly.
* **Normalization** is used to initialize a good damping parameter $\lambda$;
* **Pointwise least-squares** is used to estimate strain distribution.
